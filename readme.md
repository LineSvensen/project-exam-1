In this project, we were assigned to create a blog for a client (company) where the owner (blog author) can create, edit and delete post - but also register new accounts. Users/visitors of the blog would be able to see homepage and full post, but not able to access admin pages (create, edit, delete, register).

## Reflection note:

This project was both fun and challenging. I have learned a lot more about API and tokens. No doubt that token was the most challenging part. 

Starting off, I tried to vision the complete blog. What helped me a lot, is my past as a blogger on the platform blogg.no.

The design is reflecting the client's brand: creative, playful, tech and modern.
