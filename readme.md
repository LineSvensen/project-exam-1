# Project exam: Blog

### Welcome to this repo where it holds the code for the blog LS DEV (Line Svensen Developer) where the client/owner are able to log in, register new user and create/edit/delete blog posts. This project is a part of my Front-end development education at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. 

### Click here to view the blog: https://project-exam-1.vercel.app/

In this project, we were assigned to create a blog for a client (company) where the owner (blog author) can create, edit and delete post - but also register new accounts. Users/visitors of the blog would be able to see homepage and full post, but not able to access admin pages (create, edit, delete, register). 

        Client/company: LS DEV ENK
        Owner/blog author: Line Svensen
        Sector: Front end developer blog
        Size: None employees, only Line Svensen
        Location: Worldwide
        Mission: Line wants to share her journey and skills as a junior Front-end developer student to attract future employer(s) and customers.

## Reflection note:

This project was both fun and challenging. I have learned a lot more about API and tokens. No doubt that token was the most challenging part. 

Starting off, I tried to vision the complete blog. What helped me a lot, is my past as a blogger on the platform blogg.no.

The design is reflecting the client's brand: creative, playful, tech and modern.   

Feel free to contact me if you have questions or are interested in my work üòÉ
