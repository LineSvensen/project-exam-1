        <p class="paragraph-about-me">That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.
            In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?
            Let's build an almighty mountain. Trees grow however makes them happy. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Play with the angles. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.
            Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. It's all a game of angles. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. It takes dark in order to show light. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.
            If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. A beautiful little sunset. We have a fantastic little sky!
            Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Nothing wrong with washing your brush. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Imagination is the key to painting.
            Let's get wild today. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here.</p>
